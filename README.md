# Gaia DR2 ScoCen

This repository contains python notebooks to retrieve ScoCen stars information from *Gaia DR2*. 

__Gaia_AstroQuery.ipynb__: produces a file with different columns for objects in the Gaia DR2 database if they satisfy some selection criteria.

__Data_Selection.ipynb__: includes an extra step to clean *Gaia DR2* data to avoid bad photometry and colors. This also allows to select the pre-main sequence stars from the *CMD* and create a figure in galactic coordinates to visualize the position of these stars.

The equatorial coordinates (__Ra__, __Dec__), as well as the galactic coordinates (__l__, __b__) for each pre-main sequence star are saved in a coordinates file.

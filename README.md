# Gaia DR2 ScoCen [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/135638615.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/135638615)


This repository contains python notebooks to reproduce the Color-Magnitude diagram of Sco-Cen region drawn by the young stellar population using *Gaia DR2* data.

__Gaia_AstroQuery.ipynb__: produces a file with different columns for objects in the Gaia DR2 database, if they satisfy some selection criteria.

__Data_Selection.ipynb__: includes an extra step to clean *Gaia DR2* data to avoid bad photometry and colors. This file also allows to select the pre-main sequence stars from the *CMD* and create a figure in galactic coordinates to visualize the position of these stars.

__Interactive_Path_Selection.ipynb__: includes the main routine to select the polygon path which will be used to select the pre-main sequence stars.

The equatorial coordinates (__Ra__, __Dec__), as well as the galactic coordinates (__l__, __b__) for each pre-main sequence star,  are saved in a coordinates file. 

# Requirements

__Astropy__ (http://www.astropy.org/), __Astroquery__ (http://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and __Matplotlib__ (https://matplotlib.org/) are needed to execute the notebooks properly. 

The notebooks need to be executed in this order: 

__(i)__  Gaia_AstroQuery.ipynb to obtain the data.

__(ii)__ Interactive_Path_Selection.ipynb if the user wants to select their own region. 

__(iii)__ Data_Selection.ipynb can be used directly after step __(i)__ to use the original path selected in our sample. 

An original copy is saved in folder __Original_Copy__; thus, the user can run the notebooks, modify the queries and paths, overwriting the files and compare to the original selection in our work.
